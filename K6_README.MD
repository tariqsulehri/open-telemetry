The best developer
experience for load testing


Run the Script
=====================
k6 run k6-advanced-scenarios.js


The script will generate load across all scenarios sequentially, producing traces in Jaeger, logs in Loki, and metrics in Prometheus.


If you want, I can also generate a ready-to-import Grafana dashboard JSON with:

Request latency graphs

Error rates
Active VUs
Trace links to Jaeger

This would give full observability from load test → traces → logs → metrics.

Do you want me to generate that Grafana dashboard?
